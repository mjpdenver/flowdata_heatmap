## About these apps...

This is a quick example of creating heat maps to illustrate daily flow time series using R.  These plots were created using daily flow data provided by Richard Koehler - NOAA an inspired by his presentation at the recent AWRA National Conference in Denver.  This was just a quick example, and obviously there is a lot more adjusting that can be done with these plots.

More information about R can be found at <https://www.r-project.org/>.

This is an example of a shiny app and the code using to create this can be found on github at <https://github.com/mjpdenver/flowdata_heatmap>.

For those new to R, a much simpler example of creating an heatmap using R can be found below.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

library(ggplot2)
dat <- read.csv("lees ferry_test data.csv")

p <- ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = wy.day, y = wy.year, fill = flow))
p + geom_tile() + labs(x = "Day of Year", y = "Year") +
                  scale_fill_gradient(low="yellow",  high="red", guide="colorbar")


```
